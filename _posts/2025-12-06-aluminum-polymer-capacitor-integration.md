# Aluminum Polymer Capacitor Integration: Bridging the Supercap-Ceramic Gap

The cascading power architecture prescribes four layers: solar → LTO battery → supercapacitor → ceramic capacitors. But field testing revealed a gap: the supercapacitor fails at -55°C, yet the ceramic bank is sized only for minimum viable transmission (60ms SF7 pulses). Between these extremes lies a regime where we need more capacitance than ceramics provide but less ESR than the frozen supercap allows.

The solution: add a 3300µF aluminum polymer capacitor in parallel with the 1.5F supercapacitor. Aluminum polymer technology offers a sweet spot—moderate capacitance (3300µF vs 1.5F for supercap, vs ~1mF for ceramics) with solid polymer electrolyte that doesn't freeze like the organic electrolyte in EDLCs.

This characterization validates the aluminum polymer integration by testing the complete hybrid stack: **2× HTC1015 LTO cells in series, 1.5F supercapacitor, and 3300µF aluminum polymer capacitor—all in parallel.** The test uses two pulse profiles to separately characterize capacitive behavior (60ms pulses) and ESR-dominated behavior (2s pulses), revealing exactly when each component takes over.

## Why Aluminum Polymer?

Aluminum polymer capacitors use conductive polymer as the cathode instead of liquid electrolyte:

| Property | EDLC Supercap | Aluminum Polymer | Ceramic (MLCC) |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Capacitance | 0.1-10F | 10-1000µF | 1-100µF |
| Voltage | 2.7-5.5V | 2-25V | 6.3-50V |
| ESR (25°C) | 10-500mΩ | 5-50mΩ | <10mΩ |
| ESR (−60°C) | 10-100Ω (catastrophic) | 50-200mΩ (usable) | <10mΩ |
| Temperature coefficient | Fails below -40°C | Stable to -55°C | Stable to -65°C+ |
| Energy density | High | Medium | Low |
| Electrolyte | Organic liquid | Solid polymer | Solid ceramic |

**The key advantage**: Aluminum polymer capacitors use a **solid polymer electrolyte** that maintains ionic conductivity at temperatures where liquid electrolytes freeze. They won't match ceramics at -65°C, but they significantly outperform EDLCs below -50°C.

**The trade-off**: Lower capacitance than supercaps (3.3mF vs 1500mF), but higher than a practical ceramic bank. This positions aluminum polymer as an intermediate layer.

## Test Configuration

**Complete Hybrid Stack:**
- **2S LTO Battery**: Two HTC1015 cells in series (4.8V nominal, 40mAh)
- **Supercapacitor**: 1.5F, 5.5V rated EDLC
- **Aluminum Polymer**: 3300µF (3.3mF), 6.3V rated
- All three in parallel

**Test Methodology:**

Two pulse profiles at each temperature from +20°C to -65°C:

| Pulse Type | Current | Duration | Purpose |
|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Short pulse** | 50 mA | 60 ms | Capacitance-dominated response—tests pulse delivery capability |
| **Long pulse** | 25 mA | 2000 ms | ESR-dominated response—reveals impedance barriers |

**Why two pulses?**

The short 60ms pulse extracts only 3mC of charge:
- At 1.5F supercap: ΔV = Q/C = 3mC/1.5F = 2mV (negligible)
- At 3.3mF aluminum polymer: ΔV = 3mC/3.3mF = 0.9V

The short pulse tests whether *any* capacitor can deliver at extreme cold.

The long 2000ms pulse extracts 50mC of charge:
- At 1.5F supercap: ΔV = 50mC/1.5F = 33mV (if functional)
- At 3.3mF aluminum polymer: ΔV = 50mC/3.3mF = 15V (impossible—drains completely)

The long pulse tests whether the battery can sustain load through the impedance chain.

The divergence between short and long pulse behavior reveals ESR vs capacitance effects.

## Results: The Temperature Cascade

The test data reveals clean transitions between operating regimes:

![Voltage Under Load]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-12-06-aluminum-polymer-capacitor-integration/voltage_under_load_vs_temperature.png)

### Regime 1: Full System Functional (+20°C to -40°C)

| Temp | V_open | V_load (50mA/60ms) | V_load (25mA/2s) | ΔV (short) | ΔV (long) |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| +20°C | 4.99V | 4.85V | — | 0.14V | — |
| -40°C | 4.98V | 4.73V | 4.82V | 0.25V | 0.16V |

**Behavior:** All three layers work together. The LTO battery can supply current directly. Supercap provides buffering. Aluminum polymer is essentially idle—the system doesn't need it yet.

**Effective impedance:** 0.14V / 50mA = 2.8Ω at +20°C

### Regime 2: Supercapacitor Functional (-40°C to -50°C)

| Temp | V_open | V_load (50mA/60ms) | V_load (25mA/2s) | ΔV (short) | ΔV (long) |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| -45°C | 4.94V | 4.80V | 4.74V | 0.14V | 0.20V |
| -50°C | 4.78V | 4.69V | 4.63V | 0.09V | 0.15V |

**Behavior:** The supercap's 1.5F easily absorbs short pulses (2mV theoretical sag). Long pulses show the battery ESR increasing—more voltage sag on sustained loads.

**Key observation:** Short pulses have *less* sag than long pulses. This is the supercap doing its job—buffering transient demands while the battery struggles with sustained current.

### Regime 3: Supercapacitor Degrading (-50°C to -58°C)

| Temp | V_open | V_load (50mA/60ms) | V_load (25mA/2s) | ΔV (short) | ΔV (long) |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| -52°C | 4.53V | 4.42V | 4.39V | 0.11V | 0.14V |
| -54°C | 4.48V | 4.38V | 4.33V | 0.10V | 0.15V |
| -56°C | 4.38V | 4.28V | 4.21V | 0.10V | 0.17V |

**Behavior:** The supercap ESR is increasing but not yet catastrophic. Short pulses remain well-buffered. The aluminum polymer capacitor begins contributing to pulse delivery as supercap ESR rises.

**The transition zone:** Between -50°C and -58°C, the system gracefully shifts from supercap-dominated to aluminum-polymer-dominated pulse response.

![Voltage Sag]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-12-06-aluminum-polymer-capacitor-integration/voltage_sag_vs_temperature.png)

### Regime 4: Supercapacitor Failed, Aluminum Polymer Takeover (-58°C to -65°C)

| Temp | V_open | V_load (50mA/60ms) | V_load (25mA/2s) | ΔV (short) | ΔV (long) |
|------|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| -58°C | 3.87V | 3.05V | 2.93V | 0.82V | 0.94V |
| -60°C | 3.60V | 2.55V | 2.70V | 1.05V | 0.90V |
| -61°C | 3.51V | 2.54V | **0.21V** | 0.97V | 3.30V |
| -62°C | 2.90V | 1.90V | — | 1.00V | — |
| -64°C | 2.30V | 1.29V | — | 1.01V | — |
| -65°C | 1.25V | 0.27V | — | 0.98V | — |

**The critical data point at -61°C:**

- Short pulse (50mA × 60ms): V_load = 2.54V ✓ (marginal but usable)
- Long pulse (25mA × 2s): V_load = 0.21V ✗ (complete collapse)

This is NOT a surprise—it's ESR vs capacitance in pure form:

**Short pulse (3mC extraction):**
$ \Delta V = \frac{Q}{C} = \frac{3mC}{3.3mF} = 0.91V $

The measured 0.97V matches almost exactly. The aluminum polymer capacitor successfully delivers the RF transmission burst. The 50mA pulse flows through the aluminum polymer's ~20Ω cold ESR without collapse.

**Long pulse (50mC extraction):**
$ \Delta V = \frac{Q}{C} = \frac{50mC}{3.3mF} = 15V $

Impossible—the capacitor would need to go negative. Instead, within ~200ms the aluminum polymer is depleted. The remaining current (25mA × 1.8s) must flow through:
- Frozen supercap ESR: ~50-100Ω
- Frozen LTO battery: ~100+Ω per cell = 200Ω+

Total path resistance: ~300Ω. At 25mA: V_drop = 7.5V. From 3.5V open circuit → collapse to near zero.

**The architecture works:** Short RF transmission bursts succeed because the aluminum polymer capacitor delivers the pulse. Sustained loads fail because the frozen supercap and battery cannot replenish the aluminum polymer fast enough.

## The ESR vs Capacitance Story

The divergence between short-pulse and long-pulse behavior tells the complete story:

![Effective Resistance]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-12-06-aluminum-polymer-capacitor-integration/effective_resistance_vs_temperature.png)

**Effective resistance: R_eff = ΔV / I**

| Temp | R_eff (50mA/60ms) | R_eff (25mA/2s) | Interpretation |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| +20°C | 2.8Ω | — | Low impedance, healthy system |
| -40°C | 5.0Ω | 4.0Ω | Slight increase, all layers functional |
| -50°C | 1.8Ω | 6.0Ω | Short pulse: capacitive; long pulse: resistive |
| -56°C | 2.0Ω | 6.8Ω | Divergence begins |
| -58°C | 16.4Ω | 37.6Ω | **ESR cliff** |
| -60°C | 21.0Ω | 36.0Ω | Aluminum polymer dominant for short pulses |
| -61°C | 19.4Ω | **132Ω** | Short pulses work; long pulses impossible |
| -65°C | 19.7Ω | — | At OCV limit |

**Key insight:** The short-pulse resistance (50mA/60ms) stabilizes at ~20Ω from -58°C to -65°C. This is the aluminum polymer's cold ESR—high but manageable for 60ms RF bursts, delivering:

$ P_{delivered} = V_{load} \times I = 2.5V \times 50mA = 125mW $

For a minimal SF7 packet requiring ~100mW for 60ms, this works.

The long-pulse resistance explodes from 37Ω at -60°C to 132Ω at -61°C because:
1. Aluminum polymer depletes within ~200ms (Q = 3.3mF × 3V = 10mC at 50mA = 200ms)
2. Remaining 1800ms must flow through frozen supercap + battery
3. Combined ESR > 100Ω causes voltage collapse

## Effective Capacitance Analysis

The effective capacitance reveals which component is doing the work:

$ C_{eff} = \frac{I \times t}{\Delta V} $

![Effective Capacitance]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-12-06-aluminum-polymer-capacitor-integration/effective_capacitance_vs_temperature.png)

| Temp | C_eff (50mA/60ms) | C_eff (25mA/2s) | Interpretation |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| +20°C | 21 mF | — | Battery + supercap contributing |
| -40°C | 12 mF | 312 mF | Supercap buffers long pulses |
| -50°C | 33 mF | 333 mF | Supercap dominant |
| -56°C | 30 mF | 294 mF | Supercap degrading |
| -58°C | 3.7 mF | 53 mF | **Handoff to aluminum polymer** |
| -60°C | 2.9 mF | 56 mF | Aluminum polymer only for short pulses |
| -61°C | 3.1 mF | 15 mF | Short: capacitor; long: ESR-dominated |

**The handoff at -58°C:**

Above -58°C: C_eff > 10mF (supercap + battery contributing)
Below -58°C: C_eff ≈ 3mF (aluminum polymer only)

The 3.3mF aluminum polymer shows up exactly as expected—effective capacitance matches the component value when it becomes the sole functional capacitor.

## Power Delivery Capability

The practical question: can we transmit at stratospheric temperatures?

![Power Delivery]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-12-06-aluminum-polymer-capacitor-integration/power_delivery_vs_temperature.png)

**LoRaWAN Requirements:**
- Standard transmission: 50mA × 3.3V = 165mW for 100-200ms
- Reduced SF7 transmission: 50mA × 3.3V = 165mW for 60ms

**Power delivered at load voltage (P = V_load × I):**

| Temp | Power (50mA pulse) | Power (25mA pulse) | Capability |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| +20°C | 243 mW | — | Full power |
| -40°C | 237 mW | 121 mW | Full power |
| -50°C | 235 mW | 116 mW | Full power |
| -56°C | 214 mW | 105 mW | Full power |
| -58°C | 153 mW | 73 mW | **Marginal** |
| -60°C | 128 mW | 68 mW | SF7 only |
| -61°C | 127 mW | 5 mW | Short pulses only |
| -64°C | 65 mW | — | Below minimum |
| -65°C | 13 mW | — | Failed |

**The operating envelope:**

| Temperature | Transmission Mode | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Above -50°C | Full power SF10/SF12 | All layers functional |
| -50°C to -58°C | SF7-SF10 | Supercap buffering |
| -58°C to -61°C | SF7 short burst only | Aluminum polymer takes over |
| Below -61°C | Data logging only | OCV collapse |

## Where Aluminum Polymer Fits in the Cascade

The original four-layer cascade becomes five layers with aluminum polymer:

| Layer | Component | Operating Range | Failure Mode |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Solar | Daytime only | No night power |
| 2 | 2S LTO Battery | +25°C to -50°C | ESR → 100Ω+ |
| 3 | 1.5F Supercap | -40°C to -55°C | ESR → 50Ω+ |
| **4** | **3300µF Al-Polymer** | **-55°C to -63°C** | **ESR ~20Ω (usable)** |
| 5 | Ceramic bank | Below -60°C | OCV collapse |

**The aluminum polymer fills the gap between -55°C (supercap death) and -63°C (OCV collapse).**

Without aluminum polymer, the system would need to rely entirely on the ceramic bank below -55°C. The ceramic bank is sized for minimum viable transmission (60ms SF7), but the aluminum polymer provides higher capacitance (3.3mF vs ~1.3mF ceramic bank) with acceptable cold ESR.

## Design Recommendation

Based on characterization, the hybrid energy storage configuration is validated for stratospheric operation:

**Final Configuration:**
- **2× HTC1015 LTO cells** (2S, 4.8V nominal, 80mAh total)
- **1× 1.5F supercapacitor** (5.5V, ~3g)
- **1× 3300µF aluminum polymer** (6.3V, ~1g)
- **6× 220µF ceramics** (1.32mF bank, 6.3V, ~6g backup)

**Firmware Adaptive Transmission:**

```
if (temperature > -50°C):
    mode = FULL_POWER          # SF10-SF12, any duration
elif (temperature > -58°C):
    mode = SUPERCAP_BUFFERED   # SF7-SF10, up to 200ms
elif (temperature > -63°C):
    mode = ALUMINUM_POLYMER    # SF7 only, 60ms max
else:
    mode = DATA_LOGGING        # No transmission, log to flash
```

## Conclusion: The Bridge Layer Works

The 3300µF aluminum polymer capacitor fills a critical gap in the cascading power architecture:

1. **Supercap fails at -55°C** with ESR increasing to 50+Ω
2. **Aluminum polymer maintains ~20Ω ESR at -60°C**—high but usable for 60ms pulses
3. **Battery OCV collapse at -63°C** sets the absolute floor
4. **The aluminum polymer extends usable transmission by ~8°C** beyond supercap failure

The ESR vs capacitance behavior is exactly as expected:
- Short pulses (60ms): Dominated by capacitance → aluminum polymer (3.3mF) delivers successfully
- Long pulses (2s): Dominated by ESR → frozen supercap/battery cannot sustain → collapse

**For the standard stratospheric temperature of -56.5°C**, the system operates in the aluminum-polymer-assisted regime with ~6°C margin to failure. The hybrid stack provides graceful degradation rather than hard failure.

The aluminum polymer addition costs 1g and ~$0.50. It extends the operating envelope by 8°C. That's 0.125°C per cent—arguably the best value component in the entire power system.

## Addendum: Leakage Current Investigation — Why the Aluminum Polymer Capacitor Was Removed from the Design

After completing the initial characterization above, an anomaly in the test data prompted further investigation. The conclusion: **the aluminum polymer capacitor introduces unacceptable parasitic losses and has been removed from the Stratosonde design.** This section documents the failure analysis and lessons learned.

### The Anomaly: Lower OCV During Testing

During the aluminum polymer characterization, the LTO cell open-circuit voltage (OCV) was consistently lower than observed in previous test runs at comparable temperatures. At first, this was dismissed as normal variation—but the magnitude of the discrepancy warranted investigation.

**Cross-Test OCV Comparison (2S LTO Configuration):**

| Temperature | Ceramic Bank Test | LTO+Supercap Test | Aluminum Polymer Test | Discrepancy |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| -50°C | — | 5.09V | 4.78V | **−6%** |
| -55°C | 5.07V | 5.05V | ~4.48V | **−11%** |
| -58°C | — | — | 3.87V | — |
| -60°C | 4.70V | 4.90V | 3.60V | **−23% to −26%** |
| -65°C | 3.33V | — | 1.25V | **−62%** |

The aluminum polymer test showed substantially lower OCV at every overlapping temperature point. At -60°C, the discrepancy exceeds 1V—a significant fraction of the total battery voltage.

![OCV Comparison Across Tests]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-12-06-aluminum-polymer-capacitor-integration/ocv_comparison_across_tests.png)

The plot above makes the discrepancy visually unmistakable: while the ceramic bank test and LTO+supercap test show nearly identical OCV curves (both starting ~5.1V and following similar degradation), the aluminum polymer test curve is shifted dramatically lower—especially at the extreme cold temperatures where we need every millivolt.

### Root Cause: Aluminum Polymer Leakage Current

The Kyocera RPF1014332M006K datasheet specifies a maximum leakage current of **4.4mA at rated voltage (6.3V) and room temperature.** This specification was noted during component selection but underestimated in its impact.

To quantify the actual leakage behavior, a dedicated characterization was performed across temperature and voltage:

**Measured Leakage Current (mA) vs Temperature and Voltage:**

| Temp (°C) | 2.5V | 3.0V | 3.5V | 4.0V | 4.5V | 5.0V | 5.5V |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| +20 | — | — | — | — | — | — | **7.54** |
| +10 | 0.23 | 0.36 | 0.54 | 0.78 | 1.14 | 1.87 | 5.36 |
| 0 | 0.21 | 0.33 | 0.50 | 0.74 | 1.14 | 1.65 | 3.86 |
| −20 | 0.19 | 0.29 | 0.44 | 0.65 | 0.95 | 1.40 | 2.50 |
| −40 | 0.17 | 0.27 | 0.40 | 0.58 | 0.85 | 1.24 | 1.98 |
| −50 | 0.16 | 0.25 | 0.38 | 0.57 | 0.80 | 1.17 | 1.79 |
| −60 | 0.16 | 0.25 | 0.37 | 0.54 | 0.78 | 1.13 | 1.70 |
| −70 | 0.12 | 0.19 | 0.28 | 0.40 | 0.57 | 0.30 | 1.13 |

**Key Observations:**

1. **Room temperature leakage exceeds datasheet maximum**: At 5.5V and +20°C, measured leakage was 7.54mA—72% above the 4.4mA maximum specification. The datasheet specification applies at 6.3V; extrapolating to 5.5V should yield *lower* leakage.

2. **Leakage is strongly voltage-dependent**: At −60°C, leakage drops from 1.70mA (at 5.5V) to 0.54mA (at 4.0V)—a 3× reduction. This exponential voltage dependence is characteristic of aluminum electrolytic leakage mechanisms.

3. **Temperature reduces leakage significantly**: From +20°C to −60°C at 5.5V, leakage drops from 7.54mA to 1.70mA—a 4.4× improvement. Cold temperatures slow the electrochemical processes responsible for leakage.

4. **Even cold leakage is substantial**: At typical 2S LTO operating voltage (~4.5V) and stratospheric temperature (−60°C), leakage is still **0.78mA continuous**.

### Impact Analysis: The Double Penalty

The aluminum polymer capacitor imposes a double penalty on the power system:

**Penalty 1: Warm-Weather Battery Drain**

During the aluminum polymer test, the 2-hour thermal soak at each temperature allowed continuous leakage current:

At +20°C to −40°C (warm regime where supercap is functional):
- Average leakage: ~2-5mA
- Drain per 2-hour soak: 4-10mAh
- Cumulative drain across warm soak points: **~20-30mAh**

For a 40mAh LTO cell pack, this represents **50-75% of total capacity** lost to leakage before reaching the extreme cold temperatures where the aluminum polymer was supposed to provide benefit.

**Penalty 2: Depleted Battery When Most Needed**

The lower OCV observed at extreme cold (−58°C to −65°C) directly results from the warm-weather drain:

| Test | OCV at −60°C | Probable Cause |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Ceramic bank test | 4.70V | Fresh battery, no aluminum cap leakage |
| LTO+Supercap test | 4.90V | Fresh battery, no aluminum cap leakage |
| Aluminum polymer test | 3.60V | **Battery depleted by 30+ mAh of warm leakage** |

The 1.1-1.3V lower OCV at −60°C directly translates to reduced transmission capability—exactly when the aluminum polymer was supposed to bridge the gap between supercap failure and ceramic operation.

### The Datasheet Warning We Ignored

The 4.4mA maximum leakage specification was visible from the start. For a 40mAh battery pack, this represents:

$ t_{drain} = \frac{Q_{battery}}{I_{leakage}} = \frac{40mAh}{4.4mA} = 9.1 \text{ hours} $

**A fully charged battery would be completely drained in under 10 hours** from aluminum polymer leakage alone—even with no other loads.

The error was assuming that cold temperatures would eliminate the leakage concern. While cold *reduces* leakage (to ~0.8-1.7mA at stratospheric temperatures), the damage occurs during the warm phase:

- Ground handling at room temperature
- Initial ascent through temperate troposphere
- Thermal chamber soak periods during testing

By the time the balloon reaches extreme cold altitudes where the aluminum polymer's low ESR matters, the battery has already been significantly depleted.

### Why Not Just Disconnect the Aluminum Cap When Warm?

A theoretical mitigation would be to use a MOSFET switch to disconnect the aluminum polymer capacitor during warm operation and only engage it below −50°C when the supercap fails.

**Problems with this approach:**

1. **Added complexity**: Switch, gate driver, temperature-based control logic
2. **Switch resistance**: Even a good MOSFET adds 10-50mΩ in the critical power path
3. **Failure modes**: Switch stuck open → no cold operation; stuck closed → original problem
4. **Mass penalty**: ~0.5g for switch components, negating the 1g aluminum polymer

The complexity isn't justified when a simpler solution exists.

### The Alternative: Larger Ceramic Capacitor Bank

The ceramic capacitor bank tested previously demonstrated excellent performance to −70°C with zero leakage current. The limitation was sizing—the original 408µF bank was deliberately undersized to expose the supercap-to-ceramic transition.

**Revised ceramic-only architecture:**

| Parameter | Original Design | Revised Design |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Ceramic bank size | 1.32mF (6× 220µF) | **2.2mF (10× 220µF)** |
| Mass | 6g | 10g |
| Leakage current | 0 | 0 |
| ESR at −60°C | <50mΩ | <50mΩ |
| Cost | ~$3 | ~$5 |
| Operating range | −55°C to −65°C | −55°C to −65°C |

The 4g mass penalty (10g vs 6g) is offset by removing the 1g aluminum polymer capacitor, yielding a net increase of only 3g.

**Critically**: Zero leakage means the battery arrives at extreme cold temperatures at full state-of-charge, maximizing the available energy for transmission.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Leakage specifications matter for small batteries**: A "mere" 4.4mA leakage is catastrophic for a 40mAh battery pack. Always calculate drain time: $t = Q/I$.

2. **Warm-weather parasitic losses compound**: Components that operate during warm portions of the mission profile drain energy that's desperately needed later.

3. **Cold-temperature benefits don't erase warm-temperature costs**: The aluminum polymer's improved cold performance was irrelevant because the battery was already depleted.

4. **Solid dielectrics > liquid/polymer electrolytes for extreme environments**: Ceramic capacitors have zero leakage because they use solid ceramic dielectric. No liquid = no leakage paths.

5. **The datasheet tried to warn us**: The 4.4mA maximum leakage was right there. Component selection should have included a power budget analysis showing this was incompatible with the battery capacity.

### Revised Conclusion: Component Rejected

The aluminum polymer capacitor Kyocera RPF1014332M006K **is not suitable** for the Stratosonde cascading power architecture. While its cold-temperature ESR performance is adequate, the continuous leakage current creates an unacceptable energy loss that defeats its intended purpose.

**Revised Final Configuration:**
- **2× HTC1015 LTO cells** (2S, 4.8V nominal, 80mAh total)
- **1× 1.5F supercapacitor** (5.5V, ~3g)
- ~~**1× 3300µF aluminum polymer** (6.3V, ~1g)~~ **REMOVED**
- **10× 220µF ceramics** (2.2mF bank, 6.3V, ~10g)

The ceramic bank absorbs the aluminum polymer's intended role with no parasitic losses, proven extreme-cold performance, and only 3g additional mass.

elif (temperature > -55°C):
    mode = SUPERCAP_BUFFERED   # SF7-SF10, up to 200ms
elif (temperature > -65°C):
    mode = CERAMIC_ONLY        # SF7 only, 60ms max
else:
    mode = DATA_LOGGING        # No transmission, log to flash
```

This experience reinforces a fundamental principle of space-constrained, energy-limited system design: **every milliamp counts, especially the ones you can't see.**
