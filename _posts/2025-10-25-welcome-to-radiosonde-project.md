# Welcome to the Radiosonde Project Blog

I'm excited to announce the launch of this documentation site for our open-source radiosonde project. This blog will serve as a central place to share development updates, technical insights, and project milestones.

## What We're Building

This project consists of several key components:

### H3lite - Geospatial Indexing
One of the most interesting challenges we're tackling is automatic LoRaWAN region detection using embedded H3 geospatial indexing. The h3lite library provides efficient hexagonal hierarchical spatial indexing that works on resource-constrained embedded systems.

### Firmware Development
Core firmware for the radiosonde device, focusing on reliability, power efficiency, and accurate sensor readings.

### Hardware Design
Open-source PCB designs and schematics that anyone can use or modify for their own radiosonde projects.

### Tools & Utilities
Supporting tools for development, testing, and deployment.

## What's Next

Stay tuned for upcoming posts about:
- Deep dive into H3 geospatial indexing
- LoRaWAN region detection implementation
- Hardware design decisions
- Testing and validation results
- Deployment experiences

## Get Involved

This is an open-source project and we welcome contributions! Check out our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/your-org) to get started.

Happy tracking!
