# Welcome to the Stratosonde Project

Welcome to the technical blog for the **Stratosonde Project**—an ambitious open-source effort to design and build ultra-lightweight, solar-powered radiosondes capable of long-duration autonomous flights in the stratosphere.

## The Vision: Ultra-Long-Duration Stratospheric Flight

Imagine a radiosonde weighing less than 15 grams that can:
- Float autonomously at 40,000 feet for days or weeks
- Survive extreme temperatures (-50°C to +60°C)
- Navigate global LoRaWAN regions automatically
- Harvest solar energy to extend mission duration
- Transmit real-time atmospheric data via LoRaWAN

This is the Stratosonde—a next-generation high-altitude balloon payload that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with minimal hardware.

## Why This Matters

Traditional radiosondes are single-use devices that provide a few hours of data before falling back to Earth. The Stratosonde aims to change that paradigm by creating a platform that can:

**Collect Extended Atmospheric Data**: Days or weeks of continuous measurements at stratospheric altitudes provide unprecedented insight into atmospheric dynamics, weather patterns, and climate phenomena.

**Enable Citizen Science**: By making the design open-source and accessible, we're democratizing high-altitude atmospheric research. Amateur radio operators, students, and hobbyists can contribute to meaningful scientific data collection.

**Advance Balloon Technology**: The innovations developed here—from solar power management at extreme temperatures to autonomous region detection—benefit the entire high-altitude balloon community.

**Reduce Environmental Impact**: Long-duration flights mean fewer launches and less hardware falling back to Earth.

## What Makes This Challenging

Building a device that survives weeks in the stratosphere requires solving problems most embedded systems never face:

- **Extreme Cold**: At -50°C, lithium batteries lose 50% of their capacity and electronics behave unpredictably
- **Solar Power at Altitude**: Managing tiny solar panels (50mW) through boost converters while handling day/night cycles
- **Global Autonomy**: Automatically detecting and switching LoRaWAN regions as the balloon drifts across continents
- **Weight Constraints**: Every gram matters when you're trying to stay aloft—total system weight under 15g
- **Firmware Reliability**: No ability to update or debug once launched; it must work perfectly from day one

## The Technology Stack

### Hardware
- **MCU**: STM32WLE5 (ARM Cortex-M4 with integrated LoRa radio)
- **Power**: BQ25570 energy harvester + 2S LTO batteries + solar panels
- **Sensors**: SHT31 (temp/humidity), MS5607 (pressure/altitude), GPS
- **Target Weight**: <15 grams total system

### Firmware
- Real-time operating system for coordinated power management
- Autonomous LoRaWAN region detection using H3Lite geospatial indexing
- Adaptive transmission scheduling based on battery state
- Flash-based data logging for telemetry backup

### Software Tools
- **H3Lite Library**: Embedded H3 geospatial indexing for automatic region detection
- **Power Budget Calculator**: Interactive tool for system design and optimization
- **Balloon Float Calculator**: Physics-based altitude prediction
- **Cesium Visualization**: Real-time LoRaWAN region mapping

## Recent Progress

We've already made significant strides:

✅ **H3Lite Library**: Completed embedded implementation of H3 geospatial indexing (<50KB flash)
✅ **Interactive Calculators**: Power budget and balloon float design tools now live
✅ **Region Detection**: Autonomous LoRaWAN region switching working in firmware
✅ **Cesium Visualization**: Interactive 3D globe showing all LoRaWAN regions
