# Introducing the Balloon Float Calculator

I'm excited to announce the launch of our new interactive Balloon Float Calculator, a comprehensive educational tool for designing superpressure balloon flights. This calculator replaces our previous float calculator with a more detailed, step-by-step approach that helps users understand the physics behind balloon flight.

## Understanding Balloon Physics: The Swimming Pool Analogy

Before diving into the technical details, let's build an intuitive understanding using a familiar experience: diving in a pool.

Imagine you're diving with a weight belt pulling you down. At the surface, the weight overcomes your buoyancy and you sink. As you descend, water pressure increases and compresses the air in your lungs. Eventually, you reach a depth where you neither sink nor float—you've achieved **neutral buoyancy**, perfectly balanced between the weight pulling you down and the water pushing you up.

As you dive deeper, the water pressure continues to increase and compress your lungs further. At some point, your lungs reach their minimum compressed volume and can't shrink anymore. If you were to dive even deeper beyond this point, the pressure difference between the water outside and the remaining air inside your lungs would continue to grow, creating increasing stress on your chest.

**Here's the crucial insight:** Your high-altitude balloon works exactly the same way, just in reverse. Instead of diving into increasing water pressure, it rises through decreasing air pressure. Instead of sinking to find neutral buoyancy, it ascends to find it. The physics are identical.

But there's one critical difference: **as a diver, you can adjust your depth** by swimming up or down to find your preferred level. Your balloon cannot. Every parameter—the balloon size, payload weight, gas volume, free lift—must be calculated perfectly before launch. Once released, physics alone determines where it will float. One shot to get it right—which is exactly what this calculator helps you do.

## Design Parameters

The calculator takes your design decisions and predicts your flight performance. Here's what you control and what gets calculated:

### Inputs (Your Design Decisions)

**Balloon Volume** (e.g., 0.5 m³)
- Physical capacity of your balloon when fully inflated
- Larger volume = higher float altitude, but heavier and more expensive
- Typical party balloons: 36" Qualatex = 0.5 m³

**Balloon Weight** (e.g., 105 grams)
- Mass of the latex envelope itself
- Heavier balloon needs more lift and reduces maximum altitude
- Typical 36" Qualatex weighs ~105g

**Payload Weight** (e.g., 10 grams)
- Total mass of electronics, sensors, battery, antenna
- Every gram matters—lighter payload = higher float altitude
- Picoballoon payloads typically 5-15 grams

**Free Lift** (e.g., 8 grams)
- Extra buoyant force beyond neutral buoyancy
- Determines ascent rate and ability to overcome thermals
- Too little = slow rise; too much = wastes gas and lowers float altitude
- Typical range: 5-10 grams for picoballoons

**Gas Type** (Helium vs Hydrogen)
- Helium: Safer, 0.169 kg/m³ density
- Hydrogen: More lift (~2×), 0.085 kg/m³ density, but flammable
- Choice affects both lift capability and safety considerations

**Launch Conditions** (Elevation, Temperature, Pressure)
- Atmospheric conditions at your launch site
- Affects initial air density and gas expansion calculations
- Critical for accurate fill volume determination

### Outputs (Predicted Flight Performance)

**Gas Fill Volume** (e.g., 0.28 m³ or 280 liters)
- Exact amount of helium/hydrogen to fill at launch
- Too little = insufficient lift; too much = reduced float altitude
- This is the number you'll use when filling your balloon

**Superpressure Onset Altitude** (e.g., 8,500 m)
- Height where balloon becomes fully inflated
- Below this: balloon expands freely as external pressure decreases
- Above this: pressure builds inside the envelope
- Understanding this helps predict balloon behavior during ascent

**Float Altitude** (e.g., 10,200 m or 33,500 ft)
- Final cruising altitude where neutral buoyancy is achieved
- Where your balloon will spend most of its flight
- Determines radio line-of-sight and available power (solar angle)

**Differential Pressure** (e.g., 3.2 kPa or 0.46 psi)
- Stress on balloon envelope at float altitude
- Critical safety parameter—too high risks burst
- Qualatex 36" bursts at ~4.7-5.4 kPa
- Must stay well below burst threshold for safety margin

### The Core Trade-offs

The picoballoon design challenge involves balancing several competing factors:

**Payload Weight:** Lighter payload = higher float altitude. Every gram of payload weight requires additional lift and lowers your maximum achievable altitude.

**Balloon Size:** Larger balloon = higher float altitude BUT heavier envelope and higher cost. A bigger balloon provides more buoyancy but adds its own weight penalty.

**Differential Pressure:** Must stay well below burst limit (typically 4.7 kPa for Qualatex 36"). Higher float altitudes generally mean higher differential pressures, so you're balancing altitude goals against envelope stress limits.

**Free Lift:** Needs to be sufficient to overcome thermals and ensure steady ascent, but excess free lift wastes gas and can reduce float altitude.

The calculator helps you find the optimal combination where all these factors align for a successful, safe flight.

## Features

### Step-by-Step Physics Explanations

Rather than just showing final numbers, the calculator walks through each stage:

1. **System Density** - Overall density of your balloon+payload system
2. **Gas Fill Volume** - Launch fill calculation based on atmospheric conditions
3. **Float & Onset Altitude** - Where the balloon inflates fully and achieves neutral buoyancy
4. **Pressure Analysis** - Safety calculations for differential pressure and envelope stress

### Visual Feedback

- Color-coded calculation steps for clarity
- Interactive pressure vs altitude chart showing external pressure, internal pressure, and differential pressure
- Real-time safety indicators with clear warnings

### Safety First

The calculator provides clear safety guidance:

- ✅ **Safe** (< 4.0 kPa) - Conservative safety margin
- ⚠️ **Caution** (4.0-4.7 kPa) - Approaching burst limit, careful monitoring needed
- 🛑 **Danger** (≥ 4.7 kPa) - At or above burst limit, redesign required

Based on empirical data from Qualatex 36" balloon burst testing at 4.7-5.4 kPa differential pressure.

## Based on UKHAS SPLAT

This calculator builds upon the excellent [UKHAS SPLAT float1g calculator](https://ukhas.org.uk/doku.php?id=projects:splat), which has been used by the high-altitude balloon community for years. We've enhanced it with:

- Modern, responsive interface
- Step-by-step educational explanations
