# Stratosonde Development Blog

Technical documentation and progress updates for the Stratosonde platform - an ultra-lightweight, solar-powered radiosonde for persistent stratospheric measurements.

## About This Blog

This site documents the engineering challenges, design decisions, and testing results from developing a <15g atmospheric sensor capable of multi-day operation at stratospheric altitudes. Posts cover firmware architecture, power system optimization, thermal modeling, hardware testing, and flight results.

**Current Focus:** Platform validation through initial test flights to verify thermal models, power budgets, and trajectory predictions.

For complete project details and mission objectives, visit the [Stratosonde landing page](https://github.com/stratosonde/.github).
